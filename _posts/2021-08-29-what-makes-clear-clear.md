What is clarity? When I'm explaining something to others, I often focus on using the right terminology to describe the issue precisely, defining new jargon as needed. But in the end of the day it doesn't matter how accurate I am, all that matters is how well my audience understands what I mean.

All languages are essentially meaningless, whether written, spoken, mimed, beeped, or programmed. If I use a word which my target audience doesn't understand, my language has failed me. To my audience, I might as well be speaking gibberish.

There are two - and only two - factors which effect how clearly language is understood: throwing and catching[^1]. It's in the interest of both parties that the ball is caught, but skill is required of thrower _and_ catcher. If the thrower misses their mark, the ball is lost. If the catcher fumbles, the ball is dropped.

More often than not, you'll find yourself in the position of catcher. Too often I hear people complain of a book too hard to read, a lecture too boring to attend, code too complex to fathom, and on and on. Yes, the thrower may have missed their mark, but you're the one who benefits the most from the catch. All you need to do is become better at catching.

On the other side of the field, I just as often hear people complain their readers are too dumb, their students are too slow, or their colleagues are too ignorant. It's all too easy to fling your ball in the air and expect the catcher to miraculously receive it wherever it tumbles. But the expert pitcher doesn't rely on the catcher's skill: they fire the ball straight into their outstretched hand.
