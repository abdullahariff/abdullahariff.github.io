Before I apply for a job, I like to know what I'm supposed to accomplish before I consider joining the project. My first question to the hiring team is often "what do you expect me to accomplish in three to six months?" If I like their answer, I might accept an offer. Otherwise I keep looking. Three to six months of my time is a precious investment, and I want to be sure that when I look back, that time was well spent. 

On the other side of the table, when I'm hiring for my team, I've found the best predictor of a candidate's future success is their past success. How did they spend their past six months? What did they accomplish in the last six years? Where is their trajectory headed?

A candidate with decades of experience doing the same thing over and over again has a rather flat history compared to one with half the years but double the achievment. "Hire for slope", they say[^1]. The quicker they reached the clouds, the sooner they'll reach the stratosphere.

Most humans are naturally risk averse. Often, we choose the safer or the cushier, only to look back and regret: "man, if only...", "what if...".

So I say: write your history before you make it. Write your Résumé as you want it to be, then go and make it be.
